# Urban Freeway Cap Feasibility Explorer

A client-side React + Vite concept app that screens the feasibility of capping below-grade urban freeways using transparent rules and assumption-driven quantities.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If npm installation is blocked in your environment, inspect `package.json` for dependencies and install from an accessible registry mirror.

## Features
- Pre-curated library of below-grade freeway segments
- Structural system selection logic with memo-style sequencing
- Five-pillar feasibility scores plus weighted overall grade and color banding
- Order-of-magnitude materials, quantities, and cost range with top drivers
- Always-on disclaimer to reinforce conceptual intent
